							<h2>Chess</h2>
							<p>I am currently working on a game of wizards chess where the shape of the board can me modified at the start of the game and at runtime, rules can be altered by spells, and things are changed up just enough to keep it fresh.</p>
							<p>I have configured this project in a way that supports machine learning for AI or more traditional chess engines, even for the unique features such as spells, however this is a work in progress, and while the basic game is just about there, I expect the AI to take a bit of time to complete. </p>

							<h2>Battle Formations</h2>
							<p>A previous project inspired by Total War and MOBAs was experimenting with a game where you would control small to medium sized formations of units and have them move around you, a general.  
								This project used Utility AI and a simple state machine to control the units within the formations and how to reinforce fallen soldiers(Demonstrated in slow motion via GIF).
								This was placed on hold due to scope issues, as I believed it to be too large of a project for my given time and budget.

							<h2>Destruction</h2>
							<p>A partner and I worked on a top down shooter which featured procedural mesh generation, conversion of MagicaVoxel files to OBJ.  Much of the development time was spent optimizing the C++ plugins and experimenting with different gameplay styles to use the technology with.  While the destruction was fun to play with, we were unable to come together with a compelling vision on what to do with it.</p>

						<p>A prototype was built for an action RPG. A simple character controller was made to experiment with.  This project was intended to be a team project with three others, though I had to abandon it after a few weeks because I was the only one putting in work.</p>

						<h2>Action RPG Prototype (Pandora's Dungeon Test Project)</h2>
						<p>While working on Pandora's Dungeon, I experimented with various features in this project.  Some features would be later implemented and polished in Pandora's Dungeon, while others would not.  The ledge climbing featured here was ultimately determined to slow down the flow of the game more than I desired, so was never polished.
